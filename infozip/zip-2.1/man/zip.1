.I zipfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I zip
is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari and Macintosh.
It is analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands
.IR tar (1)
and
.IR compress (1)
and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
.LP
A companion program
.RI ( unzip (1L)),
unpacks
.I zip
archives.
The
.I zip
and
.IR unzip (1L)
programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP,
and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
.IR zip .
.I zip
version 2.1 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04.
Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04
or
.I zip
2.1. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
.I unzip
5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.
.PP
For a brief help on
.I zip
and
.I unzip,
run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.
.PP
The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;
for archiving files;
and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.
.LP
The
.I zip
program puts one or more compressed files into a single
.I zip
archive,
along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity).
An entire directory structure can be packed into a
.I zip
archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.
.I zip
has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without
compression.
.I zip
automatically chooses the better of the two for each file to be compressed.
.LP
When given the name of an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will replace identically named entries in the
.I zip
archive or add entries for new names.
For example,
if
.I foo.zip
exists and contains
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file2 ,
and the directory
.I foo
contains the files
.I foo/file1
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
then:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
will replace
.I foo/file1
in
.I foo.zip
and add
.I foo/file3
to
.IR foo.zip .
After this,
.I foo.zip
contains
.IR foo/file1 ,
.IR foo/file2 ,
and
.IR foo/file3 ,
with
.I foo/file2
unchanged from before.
.LP
If the file list is specified as
.BR \-@ ,
.I zip
takes the list of input files from standard input.
Under UNIX,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the
.IR find (1)
command.
For example,
to archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:
.IP
\fCfind . -name "*.[ch]" -print | zip source -@\fP
.LP
(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).
.I zip
will also accept a single dash ("-") as the zip file name, in which case it
will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped
to another program. For example:
.IP
\fCzip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.
.LP
.I zip
also accepts a single dash ("-") as the name of a file to be compressed, in
which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip backup -\fP
.LP
would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better compression than
the previous example using the -r option, because
.I zip
can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored
using the command
.IP
\fCunzip -p backup | tar xf -\fP
.LP
When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
.I zip
acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
For example,
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fCtar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k\fP
.LP
.I zip
archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program
.I funzip
which is provided in the
.I unzip
package, or by
.I gunzip
which is provided in the
.I gzip
package. For example:
.LP
\fPdd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -\fC
.LP
When changing an existing
.I zip
archive,
.I zip
will write a temporary file with the new contents,
and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version
has been completed without error.
.LP
If the name of the
.I zip
archive does not contain an extension, the extension
.IR .zip
is added. If the name already contains an extension other than
.IR .zip
the existing extension is kept unchanged.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI \-A
Adjust self-extracting executable archive.
A self-extracting executable archive is created by prepending
the SFX stub to an existing archive. The
.B \-A
option tells
.I zip
to adjust the entry offsets stored
in the archive to take into account this "preamble" data.
.TP
.BI \-b\ path
Use the specified
.I path
for the temporary
.I zip
archive. For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -b /tmp stuff *\fP
.RE
.IP
will put the temporary
.I zip
archive in the directory
.IR /tmp ,
copying over
.I stuff.zip
to the current directory when done. This option is only useful when
updating an existing archive, and the file system containing this
old archive does not have enough space to hold both old and new archive
at the same time.
.TP
.B \-c
Add one-line comments for each file.
File operations (adding, updating) are done first,
and the user is then prompted for a one-line comment for each file.
Enter the comment followed by return, or just return for no comment.
.TP
.B \-d
Remove (delete) entries from a
.I zip
archive.
For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\\* \\*.o\fP
.RE
.IP
will remove the entry
.IR foo/tom/junk ,
all of the files that start with
.IR foo/harry/ ,
and all of the files that end with
.I \&.o
(in any path).
Note that shell pathname expansion has been inhibited with backslashes,
so that
.I zip
can see the asterisks,
enabling
.I zip
to match on the contents of the
.I zip
archive instead of the contents of the current directory.
.IP
Under MSDOS,
.B \-d
is case sensitive when it matches names in the
.I zip
archive.
This requires that file names be entered in upper case if they were
zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.
.TP
.B \-D
Do not create entries in the
.I zip
archive for directories.  Directory entries are created by default so that
their attributes can be saved in the zip archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with sh:
.RS
.IP
ZIPOPT="-D"; export ZIPOPT
.RE
.IP
(The variable ZIPOPT can be used for any option except
.B \-i
and
.B \-x
and can include several options.) The option
.B \-D
is a shorthand
for
.B \-x
"*/" but the latter cannot be set as default in the ZIPOPT environment
variable.
.TP
.B \-e
Encrypt the contents of the
.I zip
archive using a password which is entered on the terminal in response
to a prompt
(this will not be echoed; if standard error is not a tty,
.I zip
will exit with an error).
The password prompt is repeated to save the user from typing errors.
.TP
.B \-f
Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the
.I zip
archive only if it has been modified more recently than the
version already in the
.I zip
archive;
unlike the update option
.RB ( \-u )
this will not add files that are not already in the
.I zip
archive.
For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -f foo\fP
.RE
.IP
This command should be run from the same directory from which the original
.I zip
command was run,
since paths stored in
.I zip
archives are always relative.
.IP
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for the
.B -f
,
.B -u
and
.B -o
options to work correctly.
.IP
The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other
operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two.
A typical TZ value is ``MET-1METDST'' (Middle European time with automatic
adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).
.TP
.B \-F
Fix the
.I zip
archive. This option can be used if some portions of the archive
are missing. It is not guaranteed to work, so you MUST make a backup
of the original archive first.
.IP
When doubled as in
.B \-FF
the compressed sizes given inside the damaged archive are not trusted
and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits between
the archive members. The single
.B \-F
is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, for example
if it has only been truncated, so try this option first.
.IP
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
.B \-t
option of
.I unzip
may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered;
you can remove them from the archive using the
.B \-d
option of
.I zip.
.TP
.B \-g
Grow (append to) the specified
.I zip
archive, instead of creating a new one. If this operation fails,
.I zip
attempts to restore the archive to its original state. If the restoration
fails, the archive might become corrupted.
.TP
.B \-h
Display the
.I zip
help information (this also appears if
.I zip
is run with no arguments).
.TP
.BI \-i\ files
Include only the specified files, as in:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -r foo . -i \\*.c\fP
.RE
.IP
which will include only the files that end in
.IR \& .c
in the current directory and its subdirectories. (Note for PKZIP
users: the equivalent command is
.RS
.IP
\fCpkzip -rP foo *.c\fP
.RE
.IP
PKZIP does not allow recursion in directories other than the current one.)
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
.I zip
at all directory levels.
.TP
.B \-j
Store just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not store
directory names. By default,
.I zip
will store the full path (relative to the current path).
.TP
.B \-J
Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.
.TP
.B \-k
Attempt to convert the names and paths to conform to MSDOS,
store only the MSDOS attribute (just the user write attribute from UNIX),
and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though it was not);
for compatibility with PKUNZIP under MSDOS which cannot handle certain
names such as those with two dots.
.TP
.B \-l
Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the
MSDOS convention CR LF. This option should not be used on binary files.
This option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for PKUNZIP
under MSDOS. If the input files already contain CR LF, this option adds
an extra CR. This ensure that
.I unzip -a
on Unix will get back an exact copy of the original file,
to undo the effect of
.I zip -l.
.TP
.B \-ll
Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.
This option should not be used on binary files.
This option can be used on MSDOS if the zip file is intended for unzip
under Unix.
.TP
.B \-L
Display the
.I zip
license.
.TP
.B \-m
Move the specified files into the
.I zip
archive; actually,
this deletes the target directories/files after making the specified
.I zip
archive. If a directory becomes empty after removal of the files, the
directory is also removed. No deletions are done until
.I zip
has created the archive without error.
This is useful for conserving disk space,
but is potentially dangerous so it is recommended to use it in
combination with
.B \-T
to test the archive before removing all input files.
.TP
.BI \-n\ suffixes
Do not attempt to compress files named with the given
.I suffixes.
Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
so that
.I zip
doesn't waste its time trying to compress them.
The suffixes are separated by
either colons or semicolons.  For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo\fP
.RE
.IP
will copy everything from
.I foo
into
.IR foo.zip ,
but will store any files that end in
.IR .Z ,
.IR .zip ,
.IR .tiff ,
.IR .gif ,
or
.I .snd
without trying to compress them
(image and sound files often have their own specialized compression methods).
By default,
.I zip
does not compress files with extensions in the list
.I .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.
Such files are stored directly in the output archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with csh:
.RS
.IP
setenv ZIPOPT "-n .gif:.zip"
.RE
.IP
To attempt compression on all files, use:
.RS
.IP
zip -n : foo
.RE
.IP
The maximum compression option
.B \-9
also attempts compression on all files regardless of extension.
.TP
.B \-o
Set the "last modified" time of the
.I zip
archive to the latest (oldest) "last modified" time
found among the entries in the
.I zip
archive.
This can be used without any other operations, if desired.
For example:
.IP
\fCzip -o foo\fP
.IP
will change the last modified time of
.I foo.zip
to the latest time of the entries in
.IR foo.zip .
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode;
eliminate informational messages and comment prompts.
(Useful, for example, in shell scripts and background tasks).
.TP
.B \-r
Travel the directory structure recursively;
for example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.RE
.IP
In this case, all the files and directories in
.I foo
are saved in a
.I zip
archive named
.IR foo.zip ,
including files with names starting with ".",
since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name substitution mechanism.
If you wish to include only a specific subset of the files in directory
.I foo
and its subdirectories, use the
.B \-i
option to specify the pattern of files to be included.
You should not use
.B \-r
with the name ".*",
since that matches ".."
which will attempt to zip up the parent directory
(probably not what was intended).
.TP
.B \-S
Include system and hidden files. This option is
effective on some systems only; it is ignored on Unix.
.TP
.BI \-t\ mmddyy
Do not operate on files modified prior to the specified date,
where
.I mm
is the month (0-12),
.I dd
is the day of the month (1-31),
and
.I yy
are the last two digits of the year.
For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -rt 120791 infamy foo\fP
.RE
.IP
will add all the files in
.I foo
and its subdirectories that were last modified on or after 7 December 1991,
to the
.I zip
archive
.IR infamy.zip .
.TP
.B \-T
Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the old zip file
is unchanged and (with the
.B -m
option) not input files are removed.
.TP
.B \-u
Replace (update) an existing entry in the
.I zip
archive only if it has been modified more recently
than the version already in the
.I zip
archive.
For example:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -u stuff *\fP
.RE
.IP
will add any new files in the current directory,
and update any files which have been modified since the
.I zip
archive
.I stuff.zip
was last created/modified (note that
.I zip
will not try to pack
.I stuff.zip
into itself when you do this).
.IP
Note that the
.B \-u
option with no arguments acts like the
.B \-f
(freshen) option.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.
.IP
Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the display of a
progress indicator during compression and requests verbose diagnostic
info about zipfile structure oddities.
.IP
When
.B \-v
is the only command line argument, and stdout is not redirected to a file,
a diagnostic screen is printed. In addition to the help screen header
with program name, version, and release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP
home and distribution sites are given. Then, it shows information about the
target environment (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date
and the enabled optional features used to create the
.I zip
executable.
.TP
.B \-V
Save VMS file attributes. This option is available on VMS only;
.I zip
archives created with this option will generally not be usable
on other systems.
.TP
.B \-w
Append the version number of the files to the name,
including multiple versions of files.
(VMS only; default:
use only the most recent version of a specified file).
.TP
.BI \-x\ files
Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo -x \\*.o\fP
.RE
.IP
which will include the contents of
.I foo
in
.I foo.zip
while excluding all the files that end in
.IR \& .o .
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
.I zip
at all directory levels.
.TP
.B \-X
Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid
and file times on Unix).
.TP
.B \-y
Store symbolic links as such in the
.I zip
archive,
instead of compressing and storing the file referred to by the link
(UNIX only).
.TP
.B \-z
Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire
.I zip
archive.
The comment is ended by a line containing just a period,
or an end of file condition (^D on UNIX, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VAX/VMS).
The comment can be taken from a file:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -z foo < foowhat\fP
.RE
.TP
.BI \-#
Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
.IR # ,
where
.B \-0
indicates no compression (store all files),
.B \-1
indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)
and
.B \-9
indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression, ignores
the suffix list). The default compression level is
.BR \-6.
.TP
.B \-@
Take the list of input files from standard input. File names containing
spaces must be quoted using single quotes, as in 'file name'.
.TP
.B \-$
Include the volume label for the the drive holding the first file to be
compressed.  If you want to include only the volume label or to force a
specific drive, use the drive name as first file name, as in:
.RS
.IP
\fCzip -$ foo a: c:bar\fP
.RE
.IP
This option is effective on some systems only (MSDOS and OS/2); it is
ignored on Unix.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The simplest example:
.IP
\fCzip stuff *\fP
.LP
creates the archive
.I stuff.zip
(assuming it does not exist)
and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form
(the
.I \&.zip
suffix is added automatically,
unless that archive name given contains a dot already;
this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).
.LP
Because of the way the shell does filename substitution,
files starting with "." are not included;
to include these as well:
.IP
\fCzip stuff .* *\fP
.LP
Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.
.LP
To zip up an entire directory, the command:
.IP
\fCzip -r foo foo\fP
.LP
creates the archive
.IR foo.zip ,
containing all the files and directories in the directory
.I foo
that is contained within the current directory.
.LP
You may want to make a
.I zip
archive that contains the files in
.IR foo ,
without recording the directory name,
.IR foo .
You can use the
.B \-j
option to leave off the paths,
as in:
.IP
\fCzip -j foo foo/*\fP
.LP
If you are short on disk space,
you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory
and the corresponding compressed
.I zip
archive.
In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
.B \-m
option.
If
.I foo
contains the subdirectories
.IR tom ,
.IR dick ,
and
.IR harry ,
you can:
.IP
\fCzip -rm foo foo/tom\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/dick\fP
.br
\fCzip -rm foo foo/harry\fP
.LP
where the first command creates
.IR foo.zip ,
and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each
.I zip
command,
the last created archive is deleted,
making room for the next
.I zip
command to function.
.SH "PATTERN MATCHING"
This section applies only to UNIX.
Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.
.LP
The UNIX shells
.RI ( sh (1)
and
.IR csh (1))
do filename substitution on command arguments.
The special characters are:
.TP
.B ?
match any single character
.TP
.B *
match any number of characters (including none)
.TP
.B []
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets
(example: [a\-f], [0\-9]).
.LP
When these characters are encountered
(without being escaped with a backslash or quotes),
the shell will look for files relative to the current path
that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.
.LP
The
.I zip
program can do the same matching on names that are in the
.I zip
archive being modified or,
in the case of the
.B \-x
(exclude) or
.B \-i
(include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
In general, when
.I zip
encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in
the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.
If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the
.I zip
archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters
described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the
list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the
.B \-x
option, or does not match any name given with the
.B \-i
option.
.LP
The pattern matching includes the path,
and so patterns like \\*.o match names that end in ".o",
no matter what the path prefix is.
Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]),
or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes ("").
.LP
In general, use backslash to make
.I zip
do the pattern matching with the
.B \-f
(freshen) and
.B \-d
(delete) options,
and sometimes after the
.B \-x
(exclude) option when used with an appropriate operation (add,
.BR \-u ,
.BR \-f ,
or
.BR \-d ).

.SH BUGS
.I zip
2.1 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
.I zip
1.1 to produce
.I zip
files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
.PP
.I zip
files produced by
.I zip
2.1 must not be
.I updated
by
.I zip
1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of
.I zip
or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.
The old versions can list the contents of the zip file
but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do
not have to care about this problem.
.LP
Under VMS,
not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
Only stream-LF format
.I zip
files are expected to work with
.IR zip .
Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.
This version of
.I zip
handles some of the conversion internally.
When using Kermit to transfer zip files from Vax to MSDOS, type "set
file type block" on the Vax.  When transfering from MSDOS to Vax, type
"set file type fixed" on the Vax.  In both cases, type "set file type
binary" on MSDOS.
.LP
Under VMS, zip hangs for file specification that uses DECnet syntax
.I foo::*.*.
.LP
On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the
32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such
as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.
.LP
Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different
EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's
a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability
to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by
.I zip
(which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.
.I zip
stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit
MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the
32-bit-mode size.

On the Amiga, the
.B -A
option currently does not work.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
.I Shrink.Pas
program, which inspired this project,
and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen;
to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the
.I zip
file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for
clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid
Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression
algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
Adler for providing a mailing list and
.I ftp
site for the INFO-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
INFO-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
.IR infozip.who )
without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
.I zip
would not have been possible.
Finally we should thank (blame) the first INFO-ZIP moderator,
David Kirschbaum,
for getting us into this mess in the first place.
