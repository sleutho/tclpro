Main features still missing for next official version:

- multi disk zip files
- echo "password" | zip -e archive.zip * should work (Kevin M. Fritz)
- 32 bit file attributes
- remove contractions from zip error messages, make them clearer (Steve)
- display "[text]" for ascii files when not quiet (no -q) (Timo Salmi)
- Wildcard matching issues (msg from Paul Kienitz)
- does zipnote accept names with version number?
- for a WORM, zip should create temp file only when updating; new archives
  should be created directly.
- APPNOTE.TXT specifies "4) The entries in the central directory may
  not necessarily be in the same order that files appear in the zipfile"
  but readzipfile() relies on same order.
- on Mac, MPW C 3.3.1 requires #if (a || b)  ["#if a || b" taken as "#if a"]
- on Unix, let -S be "include non-regular files without reading from them"
  (as pkzip on Unix). This requires unzip support.
- document exit codes
- zip -l should do ebcdic->ascii translation on CMS and MVS
- zip as subroutine (zdig/241)
- accept k and M in zipsplit
- store / (part of file name) as ! in OS/2 (problem only with -E ?)

Known bugs:

- On VMS, zip fails reading some files with "byte record too large for
  user's buffer". You must use the "-V" option for such files.

- zip sometimes crashes on some versions of NetBSD (0.8, 0.9 and early
  0.9-current), FreeBSD (<= 1.1) and BSDI (< 1.1) . This is due to a
  bug in stdio.
  Upgrading the stdio package in /usr/src/lib/libc/stdio should
  fix the problem. See *BSD mirrors in src/lib/libc/stdio
  You must at least replace setvbuf.o in libc.a with a newer version.

- on MSDOS, zip386.exe does not like "zip -bc: foo ..."

- on MSDOS, zip386.exe is sometimes much slower than zip.exe. This is
  probably a problem with DJGPP (to be investigated).

- on NT with C shell, zip should not do file name expansion again.

- zip zipfile ... ignores existing zipfile if name does not have an extension
  (except for the -A option, generally used on self-extracting files).

- For an sfx file without extension, "zip -A sfx" works but "zip sfx -A"
  doesn't.

- When storing files in a zipfile (-0), zip marks all of them as binary.

- On VMS, indexed files are not restored correctly after zip -V and unzip.
  (Don't know yet whether problem is in zip or unzip.)

- zip and unzip should use the same pattern matching rules, particularly
  on MSDOS and OS/2. On OS/2, "zip foo *.*" should also match files
  without extension.
  Partially DONE (OS/2 "*.*" matches "*".)

- there should be a way to avoid updating archive members (only addition
  of new files allowed)
