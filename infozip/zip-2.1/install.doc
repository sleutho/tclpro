HOW TO INSTALL ZIP

     Zip is distributed as C source code that can be compiled on a
     wide range of systems: Unix, VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, NT, Amiga, Atari,
     VM/CMS, ...  You will need Unzip 5.0p1 (under any system) or
     PKUNZIP 2.04g or later (under MSDOS) to unpack the distribution
     file, zip21.zip. But since you read this, you have unpacked it
     already, or you cheated and got a tar.Z file...

Installation on Unix

     Let's assume that you start from scratch and have not yet
     unpacked the sources. First, unpack the source as follows,
     assuming that you have zip21.zip in the current directory.

          mkdir zipsrc
          cd zipsrc
          unzip ../zip21

     This extracts all source files and documentation in the
     directory called "zipsrc". If you wish to build a version
     of zip with encryption capabilities, you must also get the
     separate package zcrypt26.zip and overwrite the dummy files
     crypt.c, crypt.h and zipcloak.c.

     You then do:

          make -f unix/Makefile system

     where "system" is one of: generic, generic_gcc,
     att6300, coherent, cray_v3, minix, sco_x286, xenix, zilog.

     Try "make -f unix/Makefile generic" first, this works on many systems.
     If this fails, then use one of the special targets given above.

     Among other special systems are Cray Unicos, Zilog Zeus and MINIX.

     If you get error messages "constant expected" in deflate.c, add
     -DDYN_ALLOC to CFLAGS in your makefile entry.

     If you have lots of memory, try compiling with -DBIG_MEM. If your
     system supports mmap(), try compiling with -DMMAP. This generally
     gives faster compression but uses more memory. See the unix/Makefile
     entry mmap_gcc for an example.

     If none of these compiles, links, and functions properly on
     your Unix system, see the file README for how to get help.

     If the appropriate system was selected, then the executables
     zip, zipnote and zipsplit will be created.  You can copy them
     to an appropriate directory in the search path using:

          make -f unix/Makefile install

     The defaults are /usr/local/bin for the executables and
     /usr/man/man1 for the manual page. Change the macros BINDIR
     and MANDIR in makefile if appropriate.

     You can use the command "set" to see the current search
     path.  If you are using the C-Shell (csh), enter the com-
     mand:

          rehash

     so csh can find the new command in the path.  You are now
     ready to use Zip.

     You can get rid of the now unnecessary source and object
     files with:

          cd ..
          rm -r zipsrc

     This will remove the directory zip and its contents created
     by unzip.  You should keep the zip20.zip file around though,
     in case you need to build it again or want to give it to a
     colleague.

     You can add the following lines to the file /etc/magic for
     usage by the 'file' command:

0	string		PK		Zip archive
>4	byte		011		(at least v0.9 to extract)
>4	byte		012		(at least v1.0 to extract)
>4	byte		013		(at least v1.1 to extract)
>4	byte		024		(at least v2.0 to extract)
>4      byte            025             (at least v2.0 to extract)


Installation on other systems

     The steps for installation under VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, NT, Amiga and
     Atari are similar to the above: first unzip the distribution
     files into their own directory. The system dependant files are
     stored in special subdirectories.

     For all the non-unix ports which support the creation of "UX" extra
     fields (these port contain USE_EF_UX_TIME in the list of optional
     features displayed with "zip -v"), the timezone environment variable TZ
     should be set according to the local timezone in order for the -f,
     -u and -o options to work correctly.

  MSDOS:

     Do one of:

          make msdos\makefile.msc               (Microsoft C 5.1)
          nmake -f msdos\makefile.msc           (Microsoft C 6.0 and newer)
          make -fmsdos\makefile.bor -DCC_REV=1  (Borland Turbo C++ 1.0)
          make -fmsdos\makefile.bor             (Borland C++ 2.0 and newer)
          make -fmsdos\makefile.tc              (Borland Turbo C 2.0)
          make -f msdos/makefile.dj1            (DJGPP v1.12m4)
          make -f msdos/makefile.dj2            (DJGPP v2)
          make -f os2/makefile.os2 gccdos       (gcc/emx 0.9b and newer)
          make -f wizdll\zipdll16.mak           (Borland C++ 2.0 and newer)
          make -f wizdll\zipdll32.mak           (Borland C++ 2.0 and newer)

     for Microsoft, Borland C++ and Turbo C, and the various free GNU C
     implementations, respectively.


  OS/2:

     Type

          {make} -f os2/makefile.os2

     to get a list of supported targets/compiling environments.
     (replace "{make}" with the name of your OS/2 make utility.)

     To initiate the actual compiling process, you have to specify
     a system target:

          {make} -f os2/makefile.os2 {system}

     An example: type

          nmake -f os2/makefile.os2 msc

     for Microsoft C 6.00.

  VMS (OpenVMS):

     Apply

          @[.vms]make_zip

     or use DEC's MMS make utility (or the MMK clone) if available:

          mms /descr=[.vms]descrip.mms /macro=(__ALPHA__=1)   for Alpha AXP
          mms /descr=[.vms]descrip.mms /macro=(__DECC__=1)    for DEC C on VAX
          mms /descr=[.vms]descrip.mms /macro=(__VAXC__=1)    for VAX C
          mms /descr=[.vms]descrip.mms /macro=(__GNUC__=1)    for GNU C on VAX

     (If you have installed both DEC C and VAX C on your VAX and want to use
      the latter compiler, you should define the macro "__FORCE_VAXC__"
      instead of "__VAXC__".)

     For further information please consult 00readme.txt in the vms/
     subdirectory.

For command help on any of the zip* utilities, simply enter
the name with no arguments.
