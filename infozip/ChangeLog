	* unzip-5.31/configure.in:
	* zip-2.1/configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS
	  value to the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD ==
	  1) squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

	* {zip,unzip}/mkIndex.tcl.in: Altered Nativepath proc to work
	  correctly with new Cygwin drive specification syntax under
	  Windows.

	* {zip,unzip}/Makefile.in: fixes for -n32 on IRIX.
