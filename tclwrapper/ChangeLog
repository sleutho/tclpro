	* configure.in: Changed to propagate an initial CFLAGS value to
	  the final definition. A TEA condition (SHARED_BUILD == 1)
	  squashed it, causing it the build system to loose the
	  +DAportable we specify for the AS PA-RISC2.2 build host. This is
	  a problem for _all_ TEA and TEA 2 based configure files.

2002-10-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* config/tcl.m4: small fix, use expanded ${PACKAGE} instead of $@
	  to work around trouble with some make's.

2001-10-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in (AC_ARG_WITH unzip): Fixed broken action-if-given
	  which used the wrong variable. Because of this a given
	  --with-unzip was not recognized.

2001-10-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in (SRC_TBCLOAD_DIR_NATIVE): Explicitly set to empty
	  in case of an empty SRC_TBCLOAD_DIR. Cygpath does not like to be
	  called without path argument.

2001-01-23  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Nuked old license directory

2000-08-24  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in:
	Added dependency on Tk to builds so that Tk_Main can be
	found (and tk.h)

2000-08-03  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* src/proInit.c:
	Moved the TclPro_Init function from the proshells module into this
	library so users can use it in custom shells.
	* src/proWrapTclMain.c:
	* src/proWrapTkMain.c:
	The ProWrap_TclMain and ProWrap_TkMain APIs are now trivially implemented
	by calls to TclPro_Init and Tcl_Main or Tk_Main, as appropriate.
	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	Nuked the unused PROWRAPU, which is made by proshells now.

2000-08-02  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.in:
	Added all the appropriate object files from ../unzip build area so
	that the wrapper library is a superset of the unzip library.  Users
	of the wrapper library shouldn't need the unzip library anymore.

2000-07-30  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Remove the util subdirectory, which became the license module.

2000-07-22  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* Changed name to "libwrapper1.4.so" and "wrapper14.dll"
	from "tclwrapper".
	Fixed memory channel to disallow writing, which was unimplemented
	and caused infinite loops in Tcl's FlushChannel routine.

2000-07-18  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* configure.in, - Fixed so tclreg and tcldde are only linked
	in to static prowrapU shells.

2000-07-12  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* Makefile.in, - added TCL_EXTRA_FLAGS to get -n32 on IRIX.

2000-07-11  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* Makefile.in, configure.in - build working to be able to
	bootstrap tclpro/modules/prowrap from the prowrap14U built here.

2000-06-23  Brent Welch <welch@ajubasolutions.com>
	* Makefile.in, configure.in - fixed up EXT_INCLUDES to
	get compiler and wrapper headers.

2000-06-06  Mike Thomas  <wart@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Turned boot83.uses into a .in file so that we can patch
	the prefix.  This is needed in order to find the installed
	Tcl library files for wrapping.

2000-06-05  Mike Thomas  <wart@ajubasolutions.com>

	* configure.in:  Removed unused "$(LDFLAGS)" from link line on
	unix.
	* Makefile.in:  Run procomp with the -nologo flag to suppress
	the copyright notice during builds.
	* boot83.uses:  Fixed path to http package.

1999-07-21  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* prowrap.tcl: fixed bug 2345.  If -uses is specified with an
	absolute path, the wrapper will not look for the file in any place
	other than that path.  Changed -encodingDir to -tcllibrary.  This
	was just a name change, not a change in functionality.

1999-07-09  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* prowrap.tcl: changed usage string to print the name of the
	executable file rather than the hardcoded string "prowrap".  I
	just rolled the code back to the 1.2 code.
