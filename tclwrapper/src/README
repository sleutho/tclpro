This directory contains the source distribution for the TclPro wrapper
library and objects.

The library can be built against the core Tcl distribution, release 8.2 or
higher; you don't need access to TclPro sources or binaries.

There is also a configurable Makefile that builds both the library and a
sample wrapper base application, which will be described below.

---- How to build and install the distribution.

1. Configure the distribution, by running the 'configure' script. You can
configure in place, or create a subdirectory of the source distribution and
configure from there; the latter approach lets you build multiple platforms
or configurations from the same sources.

The configure scripts needs to find a directory where Tcl was built.
You can specify the Tcl build directory with the --with-tcl option, whose
argument is the path to the Tcl build directory. If you don't specify a
--with-tcl option, 'configure' looks for Tcl in a sibling of the source
directory.

There are two additional options you can pass to 'configure': --enable-gcc
and --enable-symbols. The former instructs the Makefile to use GCC instead of
the native compiler, and the latter turns on debugging information. Note that,
currently, only GCC is supported on Solaris and HP-UX platforms.

And, of course, all the standard 'configure' options apply, as well.

2. Build the distribution, by running 'make' in the configured directory.
This will build the static library for the wrapper interfaces. Note that
the Makefile also expects that Tcl was installed; it links against the
installed binaries, not the ones in the build directory.

3. Install the binaries, by running the 'make install' target. This copies
the wrapper library to the 'lib' directory of the Tcl installed area.

---- The sample application

The Makefile also contains targets to generate a sample base application for
the wrapper; this is a statically-linked tclsh which calls Pro_WrapTclMain
instead of Tcl_Main. You can say 'make samples' and it will be built.

Once this is built, you can use it as input for TclPro Wrapper. Note that you
can wrap base applications from any platform on any platform that TclPro
supports, even if the base application was built on a platform that TclPro
does not support.

---- The contents of the distribution

The following files are present in this distribution:

README		    This file.
configure	    Configure script
configure.in	    The template for 'configure', for use by 'autoconf'.
Makefile.in	    The template for the Makefile that 'configure' generates.

proWrap.h	    Public header, exports the public wrapper interfaces.

proWrap.c	    The implementation of the Pro_Wrap interfaces.
tclMemChan.c	    The implementation of a memory-based Tcl channel.

unzip		    This directory contains the subset of the InfoZip
		    distribution that is included in the wrapper library.
		    It is a slightly modified version of unzip version 5.31.

sampleinit.c	    Main program for the sample base application.

proWrapTclMain.c    These two files can be used as a starting point for
proWrapTkMain.c	    creating your own version of Tcl_Main that initializes
		    the wrapper interfaces.
