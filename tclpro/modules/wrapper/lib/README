This directory can include user defined .uses files for use with
the prowrap application.  It also includes the source code for the
standard -uses options.  The standard behavior is described in the
following files:

	tclsh.uses		wish.uses
	bigtclsh.uses		bigwish.uses
	tclsh-dynamic.uses	wish-dynamic.uses
	prowrapUses.tcl

Note: These files are wrapped up inside prowrap itself, so if
you modify them you must specify them with an absolute file name.
In particular, these all share prowrapUses.tcl, and if you change
that you must reference the uses file with an absolute path.
