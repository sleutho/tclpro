.SH NAME
procheck \- TclPro Checker

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBprocheck\fR ?\fIoptions\fR? ?\fIfilePattern ...\fR?

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 15
Displays usage information, then exit without doing anything.
.IP "\fB\-nologo\fR" 15
Hides the copyright and version information. 
.IP "\fB\-quiet\fR" 15
Outputs the basic error information contained on one line, as opposed
to the three line output that includes the code body and the error
indicator.
.IP "\fB\-verbose\fR" 15
Displays version information and summary information when the checker exits.
.IP "\fB\-suppress \fImessageID\fR" 15
Suppress one or more messageIDs from being printed.  The
\fImessageID\fR argument can be a single messageID or a quoted string
of messageIDs separated by spaces.
.IP "\fB\-use \fIcheckerPackage?version?\fR" 15
Specifies the packages and versions to use for checking the script.
If the \fIcheckerPackage\fR argument is append with \fIversion\fR,
then that version of the system is used to check the scripts,
otherwise the default version is used.  The
\fIcheckerPackage?version?\fR argument can be a single package or a
quoted list separated by spaces.  If the same checker package is
specified on the command line more than once, the last version
specified is used.  See the section \fBCHECKER PACKAGES\fR for more
information. 
.IP "\fB\-W1\fR" 15
Display parsing errors and syntax errors.
.IP "\fB\-W2\fR" 15
Display parsing errors, syntax errors, and usage warnings.
.IP "\fB\-W3\fR" 15
Display parsing errors, syntax errors, usage warnings, portability
warnings, upgrade warnings and performance warnings.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 15
Same as the \fB\-W3\fR option for this version, but is guaranteed to
always print all of the messages in future releases.  This is the
default.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

The command \fBprocheck\fR is used to run TclPro Checker on files that
match the \fIfilePattern\fR command line arguments.  If no file
pattern is specified, TclPro Checker will use stdin as input.  TclPro
Checker is designed to help find syntax errors and other common usage
errors in Tcl scripts quickly, without having to run the program.
TclPro Checker will also warn about potential incompatibilities to
help upgrade applications to the latest releases of Tcl, Tk and [incr
Tcl].  The list of valid package names and versions are:

.RS
.TP
\fBtcl\fR
7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 (default)
.TP
\fBtk\fR
3.6, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 (default)
.TP
\fBincrTcl\fR
1.5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 3.1 (default)
.TP
\fBexpect\fR
5.28, 5.29, 5.30 and 5.31 (default)
.TP
\fBtclX\fR
8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 (default)

.PP
Every message printed has a messageID associated with it.  The messageID
is the word in parenthesis just after the file and line number
information.  The messageID can be used with the \fB\-suppress\fR 
option to prevent that type of message from being printed.  For
example, the following warning message is reported for any Tcl command
that is not available on all platforms.  The messageID is
\fBnonPortCmd\fR, and can be suppressed by specifying \fB-suppress\fR
\fBnonPortCmd\fR on the command line.

TclPro Checker prints the following categories of errors and warnings:
.RS
.TP
\fBparsing errors\fR
Commands that can not be parsed by the Tcl parser generate an error.
The reason for the parsing error and the location of the offending
character are reported.  TclPro Checker will attempt to skip ahead
and continue to check additional commands after the parsing error.
.TP
\fBsyntax errors\fR
Any commands that will fail because of wrong number of arguments,
invalid types, invalid options, etc. are reported.  Only commands
defined in Tcl, Tk or [incr Tcl] are checked for syntax errors.
.TP
\fBplatform portability warnings\fR
TclPro Checker generates warnings when a command is used that may be
non-portable between various platforms.
.TP
\fBsuggestions for upgrading\fR
Upgrade warnings indicate any feature that will change in a later version.
.TP
\fBperformance warnings\fR
A warning is generated when a performance optimization opportunity
is detected.
.TP
\fBusage warnings\fR
A warning is generated when a command appears to have an error, but is
perfectly legal syntax.  For example "\fBincr $counter\fR" will generate
a warning because the \fBincr\fR command expects a variable name, not a
value.  This command is probably an error, although it is possible
the variable \fBcounter\fR may contain a variable name.
.RE
.SH CHECKER PACKAGES
.PP
If the \fB\-use\fR switch is not specified default versions Tcl, Tk,
[incr Tcl], Expect and TclX (listed above) are automatically loaded to
check the Tcl scripts.  If the \fB\-use\fR switch is specified, then
Tcl is the only package implicitly loaded, and other packages must be
specified on the command line.  The following example will check the
script against Tcl, Tk and all of the supported extensions ([incrTcl],
Expect and TclX.)
.PP
.CS
procheck foo.tcl
.CE
.PP
The next example will only check the script against the latest version
of Tcl and Tk.
.PP
.CS
procheck -use tk foo.tcl
.CE
.PP
TclPro Checker attempts to load compatible versions of Tcl, Tk and
the supported extensions.  If no versions are specified, the default
version is assumend.  When a version is requested for a package, the
remaining packages will be loaded with compatable versions.  If
incompatable versions are specified, an error is generated and
procheck exits.  For example, the following command will load Tcl7.5
and Tk4.1 based on the request for [incr Tcl] version 2.1.
.PP
.CS
procheck -use tk -use incrTcl2.1 foo.tcl
.CE
.PP
However the next example will generate an error and exit because the
versions for Tcl and Tk are incompatable.
.PP
.CS
procheck -use tk3.6 -use tcl8.0 foo.tcl
.CE

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The following example shows how to check Tcl 7.5 and Tk 3.6, showing
parsing errors, syntax errors, upgrade warnings and performance
warnings.  Usage and portability warnings will not be reported.
