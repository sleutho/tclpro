README:  TclPro Demos

-------------------

This directory contains 6 demos for TclPro:

Factorial:  The fac.tcl file can be used to demonstrate TclPro
            Debugger's single-stepping features, breakpoints, and
            handling of variables.  This Tcl script can be run with
            any standard Tcl interpreter.  It requires an integer on
            the command line and computes the factorial of this value.

Hi-Q Game:  The Hi-Q game can be used to demonstrate TclPro
            Debugger's handling of call stacks, the Tk event loop,
            file sourcing, and error handling.  The Hi-Q game is
            driven by the hiq.tcl script and can be run with a Tk8.0
            interpreter.  An error is purposely generated if the 
            "Undo" button is pressed after a game piece is moved.
            This is done to demonstrate TclPro Debugger's error
            handling capabilities.

Uplevel:    The uplevel.tcl file can be used to demonstrate TclPro
            Debugger's handling of uplevel scripts.  This Tcl script
            can be run with any standard Tcl interpreter.

Compile and Wrap:
            CompileAndWrap.tcl demonstrates how to compile and wrap
            the Factorial and Hi-Q demos.  This script creates one
            stand-alone wrapped executable for each demo.  The wrapped
            executables will be in the files: demo.$plaform/fac.exe
            and demos.$plaform/hiq.exe.

            Note: This demo is omitted if TclPro Compiler and TclPro
            Wrapper are not part of the distribution.

SampleApp:  SampleApp is a directory that contains Makefiles for both
            Windows and UNIX. These Makefiles demonstrate how to build
            your own custom interpreter using TclPro template source
            files. See the file sampleApp/README and the TclPro User's
            Guide, Chapter 7, "TclPro Applications and Libraries" for
            more information.

            Note: This demo is part of the C Development Component of
            TclPro.   This demo is omitted if TclPro Compiler and
            TclPro Wrapper are not part of the distribution.

Expect:     The expect.tcl file is an augmentation of Don Libes'
            xrlogin.exp example that ships with the source release of
            Expect.  The example uses some of the more common Expect
            commands to demonstrate how to rlogin to another host
            and automatically set the DISPLAY environment variable.
            The demo may not work on all Unix systems, as
            implementations of standard unix commands may vary.

            Note:  This demo is omitted if Expect is not part of the
            distribution.  Expect is a Tcl extension that only runs on
            Unix operating systems.
