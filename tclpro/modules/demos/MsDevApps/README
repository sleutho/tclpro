These are a few examples that use the Microsoft VC++ project files
to organize some simple applications:

App1

A single Tcl file that is compiled and wrapped.

App2

A simple C program that embeds a Tcl interpreter.

App3

A C/C++ mixed application that extends [incr Tcl] by providing a Stack
template implementation in C++ for use at the script level.  It creates
a custom static shell with this extention, and then tests/compiles/wraps
up a script that uses it.
