These are a few examples that use Unix Makefiles
to organize some simple applications:

App1

A single Tcl file that is compiled and wrapped.

App2

A simple C program that embeds a Tcl interpreter.

App3

A C++ application that extends [incr Tcl] by providing a Stack class implementation in C++.
It creates a custom shell with this extention, and then wraps up a script that
uses the extension.
