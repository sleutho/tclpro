.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

TclPro Debugger is a graphical debugger for the Tcl scripting
language.  TclPro Debugger allows you to interactively step through
your Tcl scripts to find bugs as they occur.  You may also use the
TclPro Debugger to modify the state of your running Tcl application to
test hard-to-execute or otherwise unreachable code branches.

.PP

The command \fBprodebug\fR is used to start TclPro Debugger.  If you
specify a \fIprojectFile\fR on the command line, TclPro Debugger will
open the project upon startup.

.SH "USER MANUAL"
.PP
For more information, please see the TclPro User's Guide or online
help system.

.PP
The code coverage feature is a late addition to the tool and is
not documented in the user manual.  If you start \fBprodebug\fR
with the \fB-coverage\fR option then a "Show Coverage" menu entry appears under
the View menu, and a toolbar button labeled \fBC\fR appears.  These
display a simple code coverage tool that will highlight either
the code that has been executed so far, or the code that has
not been executed so far.  The idea of this tool is to show you
how well test inputs are exercising your program.
