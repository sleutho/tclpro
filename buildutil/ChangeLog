	* Modified pro_wrap.sh.in & wrap.sh.in to remove the expectation
	  that uname is in /bin -- it isn't on FreeBSD at least, and
	  config.guess doesn't force it either.

	* Cloned wrap.sh into pro_wrap.sh so we can have different
	wrap.sh scripts for Ajuba and TclPro.

	* Make the installation of wrap.sh unix-specific so a windows
	build doesn't install a cr-lf version of the file.

	* Added files for the test suite that didn't used to exist.
