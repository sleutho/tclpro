	* common/proAppInit.c: Changed the order in which files are
	  included. [Incr Tcl] defines its own EXTERN macro which messes
	  up all packages which expect the EXTERN macro from tcl
	  itself. Moved its inclusion to the end of the list. This problem
	  was found when building the big shells.

2001-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* prowish/aclocal.m4 (SC_LIB_SPEC_SUFFIX): Check explicitly for an
	  empty LIB_PATH_NAME and set LIB_SPEC explicitly for that
	  case. Cygpath chokes if it is called without a path argument.

2000-10-02 Scott Redman   <redman@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/configure.in:
	* prowish/aclocal.m4:
	Fixed search order for libwrapper to prevent from using the debug
	version in a non-debug build.

	* bigtclsh/*:
	* bigwish/*:
	* procheck/*:
	* procomp/*:
	* prodebug/*:
	* protclsh/*:
	Removed all of the files that are no longer used.  Only prowish
	should be used.  Need to merge the code in common/ and prowish/
	and make only one set of files, but not right now.

2000-08-06 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/configure.in:
	Fixed the library order of Itcl and Itk so that symbols from
	the Itcl library can be referenced from Itk.  This was breaking
	static builds after changes in the Itk stubs implementation.

2000-08-03 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/configure.in:
	Cleanup of comments and ordering of macros.
	Added Wsock32.lib to TclX libraries
	* prowish/Makefile.in:
	Added CFLAGS_DEFAULT to the COMPILE rule, which was the real reason that
	the Windows compiles didn't get the right runtime flags.
	* common/proAppInit.c:
	Removed the TclPro_Init function as this is now in the wrapper library.
	* common/sampleAppInit.c:
	Sanitized version of proAppInit.c for source example distribution.

2000-08-02 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/configure.in:
	Had to add a check from Expect to find the -lutil library on
	Linux in order to satisfy the openpty() symbol.
	Also made the check for Expect only occur on UNIX

2000-07-30 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/configure.in:
	Oops - had forgotten the configure stuff for TclX, Itcl, and Expect.
	Copied that in from the bigwish configure.in.

2000-07-30 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/Makefile.in:
	* prowish/configure.in:
	Made fixes because of changes to TCL_SRC_DIR, TK_SRC_DIR,
	and the rename of GRAHIC_LIBS to LIBS_GUI.

2000-07-28 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* prowish/Makefile.in:  Fixed permissions on installing
	binaries.

2000-07-26 David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* bigtclsh/configure.in:
	* bigwish/configure.in:
	* procheck/configure.in:
	* procomp/configure.in:
	* prodebug/configure.in:
	* protclsh/configure.in:
	* prowish/configure.in:  Added "-nologo -incremental:no" to
	LINK_FLAGS variable under windows.  I hate those warning messages.

2000-07-25 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* shell.rc.in - Finally got the correct icon names for
	windows so the proshells do not always use the Tk icon.
	* configure.in, Makefile.in, common/proAppInit.c -
	added support for static Winico and Winutil (dbgext) modules.

2000-07-22 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Finally unified the configure.in/Makefile.in into the instances
	in the prowish directory.  Those files can now build 11 different
	shells: wrapwish, wrapwishdyn, wraptclsh, wraptclshdyn, bigtclsh,
	bigtclshdyn, bigwish, bigwishdyn, procheckU, procompU, prodebugU.

2000-07-19 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* {bigwish,bigtclsh}/configure.in - lacked AC_SUBST for DL_LIB, MATH_LIB

2000-07-14 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* */configure.in: Changed librarys so that tclreg and tcldde
	libraries are only linked into static windows builds.
	* common/proAppInit.c: Added static packages for TclParser
	and TclCompiler for building procheckU, procompU, and prodebugU
	* procomp, prodebug, procheck: Static wrapper shells for these
	tools.

2000-07-14 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* */Makefile.in: Fixes for -n32 on IRIX.

2000-07-12 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Added tclreg and tcldde libraries to Windows builds as static packages.
	* Fixed XINCLUDES bug.  @XINCLUDES@ or @TK_XNCLUDES@, must always be last
	in a Makefile line because they may contain a comment character!

2000-07-10 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Another snapshot of all 8 wrapper inputs.
	These actually seem to be correctly linked on windows
	and usable by the wrapper.

2000-06-23 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Working snapshot of all 8 wrapper inputs, except that
	Expect is missing (itcl, TclX, tbcload, all done)

2000-06-21 Brent Welch  <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Added bigwish and bigtclsh modules for wrapper inputs that
	bundle extensions

2000-05-30 Scott Redman  <redman@ajubasolutions.com>

	* common/proAppInit.c:
	* common/tcl.m4:
	* protclsh/Makefile.in:
	* protclsh/protclsh.rc.in:
	* prowish/Makefile.in:
	* prowish/prowish.rc.in: Changed copyright strings to Ajuba
	Solutions to reflect the change in the company name.

2000-04-18    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* protclsh/Makefile.in:
	* protclsh/configure.in:
	* protclsh/protclsh.rc.in:
	* prowish/Makefile.in:
	* prowish/configure.in:
	* prowish/protclsh.rc.in:  Add support for --with-icon=<icon> to
	allow the Windows icon to be set during the build process.
