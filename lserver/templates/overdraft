Overdraft Status Warning

At $info(date), $info(time) there were already $info(N) users using
$info(name), and your license is for $info(max) users.

However, based on Ajuba Solutions overdraft policy,
Ajuba Solutions License Server has issued an overdraft license to allow
$info(user) at $info(host) to use $info(app) anyway.

Please make sure you have enough licenses for all of your users.
Ajuba Solutions provides you with an overdraft buffer to help you ensure
that your users can always access TclPro when they need it,
even when you are over your license limit.

There are $info(overdraft) overdraft days left before the server begins
denying requests for licenses.  Each day a user causes the server
to enter overdraft status uses one day from a total of 10 days allotted.
Any number of users can use overdraft licenses on a single overdraft day.

Please contact sales@ajubasolutions.com for more information and to
purchase additional licenses.
