Specify the location of the server's configuration files:
prolserver.conf, prolserver.state, and prolserver.pid.
The default is the same directory as the prolserver program itself.
.IP "\fB\-reset\fR" 15

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The command \fBprolserver\fR is used to run Ajuba Solutions License Server.
The license server manages shared network licenses for the TclPro products
in use at your site.  A shared network
license can replace several personal license
keys and eliminate the need for users to manage and install their own 
license keys.
Ajuba Solutions License Server also maintains records about the usage
of TclPro products for your reference.
.PP
Ajuba Solutions License Server should be installed and run on a server
machine with a TCP/IP connection
because it must be accessible for TclPro products to work
with shared network license keys.
Once running, you administer the server using a Web Browser,
and applications also contact the server using the HTTP protocol.
.PP
The listening port for the server is probably not the standard
port for web servers, so you must specify a URL that
includes the port number when accessing the server.  The official
port is 2577, but you can change that during installation.
.DS
http://\fIhostname\fP:\fIport\fP/
.DE
.PP
Normally Ajuba Solutions License Server
is started from scripts under /etc/init.d when the machine
boots up.  These scripts are created by the normal installation
process if you install as root.  Otherwise, a file named
prolserver.boot is created in your installation directory and
your system administrator must install this into the proper location.
The exact location varies depending on your operating system.

.SH FILES AND INSTALLATION
The \fBprolserver\fR application is a stand-alone application that
does not depend on the TclPro installation.  This means you can
install it on a different host than the file server that contains
the rest of the TclPro software.  The main requirement is that
the machine is accessible to users via the network.
.PP
The installation of Ajuba Solutions License server creates a number
of files.  These are explained below, although they should
be created automatically during a successful installation.

.IP "/etc/init.d/prolserver"	20
This script is only created if you install the server while
running as the root user.
This is a shell script that starts the server when the
machine boots.
You can use run this script with the "start" or "stop" argument
to start or stop the server.
This may actually be in a slightly
different location depending on your operating system
(e.g., /etc/init.d for Solaris and IRIX,
/etc/rc.d/init.d for Linux, or /sbin/init.d for HP-UX.)
There are also symbolic links to this file from the peer rc2.d and rc0.d
directories that are actually the files that cause the
server to start during boot and halt when the machine shuts down.
The exact configuration of links varies depending on the operating system.
Consult your system's reference manual for more information about
configuring services that start up at boot time.

.IP "\fIinstallDir\fP/prolserver.boot"	20
This script is only created if you do not install the server as root.
This is a copy of the script that needs to be installed under
/etc/init.d in order to automatically launch the server when the
machine boots up.  The exact location depends on the operating
system.  Consult your system administrator for help when copying
this into the correct location.

.IP "\fIinstallDir\fP/prolserver"	20
This is the application program.  This is a stand-alone application
that does not depend on the other TclPro software.

.IP "\fIinstallDir\fP/prolserver.conf"	20
This is the main configuration file.  This file captures the
installation settings for your server.  The commands available
in this file are described in the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section below.
Changes to this file take place when you restart the server.

.IP "\fIinstallDir\fP/prolserver.state"	20
This is a state checkpoint file.  This file is tamper-resistant so
you should not edit this file.  Doing so will cause you to lose the
state of active licenses, administrator passwords, and 
notification email addresses.

.IP "\fIinstallDir\fP/prolserver.pid"	20
This file records the process ID of Ajuba Solutions License Server so
it can be shutdown.

.IP "/var/log/prolserver.\fIport\fP.log"	20
This is the log file for the server.  This keeps weekly, daily,
and current usage statistics.  It is compacted automatically so
it should not get too large.  Each day at midnight the
records about the
current usage are collected into one daily record, and
each week records about daily usage are collected into
one weekly record.  Restarting the server does not truncate
this log.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
The \fBprolserver.conf\fP file can contain the commands described
below to configure the server.

.IP "\fBLogDir\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 15
The directory for the prolserver<port>.log file.
The default is /var/log.
.IP "\fBPort\fR \fInumber\fR" 15
Specify the HTTP listening port for the server.
The default is 2577.
.IP "\fBUid\fR \fIusername\fR" 15
Specify the user account that will own the server process.
Can be either a name or numeric user id.
The default is "bin".
.IP "\fBGid\fR \fIgroupname\fR" 15
Specify the group account that will own the server process.
Can be either a name or numeric group id.
The default is "bin".
.IP "\fBLicense\fR \fIkey\fR \fIproduct\fR" 15
This records a license key and the associated product name.
These are added automatically by the server when you add
licenses via the web interface.
