	* lclient.tcl:
	Had to add update calls in RequestAsync so that the POST data
	from the http::geturl would get out to the server before
	command-line tools exited.  This caused failures to release
	licenses that caused 10-minute timeouts of the license.

2000-8-04    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Makefile.in:
	Removed dependency on .tbc files in Debug builds.
	* licenseWin.tcl:
	Had to nuke the URL bindings from the licence alert dialog because
	TclPro debugger isn't initialized enough to support that
	link when it is displayed.

2000-8-01    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* lserverInstall.tcl:
	Fixed reference to tclhttpd.etc.init 

2000-7-31    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Changed Scriptics to Ajuba Solutions
	* Created aclocal.m4

2000-7-28    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Hand crafted pkgIndex.tcl to deal with .tbc files.

2000-7-18    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Fixed licenseWin.tcl and dependencies on the system module.

2000-6-22    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* General cleanup for a license module for TclPro 1.4

1999-6-2    <wart@toutatis.scriptics.com>
	* lictty.tcl:  The tty interface to prolicense no longer caches
	the server site info.  [Bug: 1286]
	Fixed typo (runnung -> running)

1999-5-7    <wart@toutatis>

	* Modified start of licdemo so that it looks in ../util for the
	lic package.  Now it can be started from any directory with:
		$ wish /ws/path/to/licdemo

	* Did the above to genkeygui.tcl as well:
		$ wish /ws/path/to/genkeygui.tcl

	* startup.tcl:  Added call to lic::promoteLicense for promoting older
	TclPro licenses.

1998-12-18    <welch@sage>

	* licdata.tcl: Moved low level packInt, unpack, and releated procs
	from licparse.tcl and licgen.tcl into this data handling module.
	Added new packString and unpackString functions used by license
	manager.

	* licparse.tcl:  Move licdata:getMsg into here where it makes more
	sense.
	NOTE API CHANGE: licdata::getMsg changed to lic::getMsg

	* lmgrclient.tcl: new support for license manager.  Still not used

	* lmgr/*: initial license manager implementation


1998-1-6    <welch@sage>

	* Working snapshot.  Note that licdata.tcl and licparse.tcl have moved
	down into the lmgr subdirectory.  The server has these features:
		Self installing with -install option
		probe, checkout, refresh, release HTTP operations
		Configuration file with port, uid, gid, license
		Checkpoint file with active state, including overdraft limits
		/license.tml to add licenses
		/debug.tml to test things and change parameters
