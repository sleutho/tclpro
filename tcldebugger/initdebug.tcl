#
# This file comprises the public interface to the TclPro Debugger for use
# by applications that are not launched directly from the debugger.  The
# public interface consists of the two commands "debugger_init" and
# "debugger_eval".  A typical application will source this file then invoke
# "debugger_init" to initiate the connection to the debugger.  Once
# connected, the application can use the "debugger_eval" command to
# evaluate scripts that the debugger will be able to step through.
# Additionally, various other Tcl commands including "source" and "proc"
# will automatically instrument code.  Any blocks of code (e.g. procedure
# bodies) that existed before "debugger_init" was invoked will execute
# without any instrumentation.
#

# Avoid redefining these functions in case this file is sourced multiple
# times.  This ensures that we only connect to one debugger at a time.

if {[info commands debugger_init] == ""} {

# debugger_init --
#
#	This function initiates a connection to the TclPro Debugger.  Files
#	that are sourced and procedures that are defined after this
#	function completes will be instrumented by the debugger.
#
# Arguments:
#	host	Name of the host running the debugger.
#	port	TCP port that the debugger is using.
#
# Results:
#	Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

    # any encoding translations.

    }

    # Send the loader and tcl library version

    set msg [list HELLO 1.0 $tcl_version]

    # contains the debugger socket channel.

	close $socket
	return 0
    }
    set msg [read $socket $bytes]
    eval [lindex $msg 1]
    return 1
}

# debugger_eval --
#
#	Instrument and evaluate a script.  This routine is a trivial
#	implementation that is replaced when the nub is downloaded.
#
# Arguments:
#	args		One or more arguments, the last of which must
#			be the script to evaluate.
#
# Results:
#	Returns the result of evaluating the script.

proc debugger_eval {args} {

# debugger_break --
#
#	This command may be inserted in user code to cause a break 
#	to occur at the location of this command.  If the application
#	is not connected to the debugger this command is a no-op.
#
# Arguments:
#	str	(Optional) String that displays in debugger.
#
# Results:
#	None.  Will send break message to debugger.

proc debugger_break {{str ""}} {
    return
}

# debugger_attached --
#
#	This command may be used to detect if the debugger is
#	currently attached to the interpreter.
#
# Arguments:
#	None.
#
# Results:
#	Returns 1 if the debugger is currently attached.

proc debugger_attached {} {
    return 0
}

# debugger_setCatchFlag --
#
#	Set the catch flag to indicate if errors should be caught by the
#	debugger.  This flag is normally set to 0 by the "catch" command.
#	This command can be used to reset the flag to allow errors to be
#	reported by the debugger even if they would normally be masked by a
#	enclosing catch command.  Note that the catch flag can be overridden by
#	the errorAction flag controlled by the user's project settings.
#
# Arguments:
#	flag	The new value of the flag.  1 indicates thtat errors should
#		be caught by the debugger.  0 indicates that the debugger
#		should allow errors to propagate.
#
# Results:
#	Returns the previous value of the catch flag.
#
# Side effects:
#	None.

proc debugger_setCatchFlag {flag} {
    return 1
}
