	* tclCom.pcx (checker): updated foreachitem table entry to accept
	either 3 or 4 arguments, where the last args is always a script.

	* analyzer.tcl:

	fully qualified proc calls. (bug 2585)

	* analyzer.tcl: changed a regexp to properly strip leading "::"s
	off a fully qualified proc name (when looking for proc bodies to
	scan).  (bug 2585)

1999-10-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bug 377 by using checkOption instead of
	checkSwitches for the -display option to the "winfo interps"
	command.

	* incrTcl.tcl: New checkFindObjs proc was added to fix bug 2510.
	Incr Tcl find command nolonger gives errors with nonliteral options.

	* Makefile.in:
	* configure.tcl:

	extension.

1999-09-03  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	analyzer::checkForeachCmd to check for varRef warning in lists of
	variable names.

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 2231 by adding a check for reference
	vars (list elements beginning with a '$') in proc's arg list.

	* coreTcl.tcl: fixed bug 743 by changing coreTcl::checkForeachCmd
	to check for a variable name in all odd args except the last arg.

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug 2485 by changing analyzer::checkVarName
	to complain if the 1st elt of 1st elt of subtokens is "variable"
	regardless of the size of the subtoken list.

1999-08-01  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* blt.tcl:
	* configure.tcl:
	* coreTcl.tcl:
	* coreTk.tcl:
	* expect.tcl:
	* incrTcl.tcl:
	* tclX.tcl: fixed bug that caused check to crash when built in

	procedure name ::analyzer::warn instead of "warn".

1999-07-27  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl: fixed bug that caused checker not to read from
	stdin if -onepass flag is used.

	* message.tcl: added new message ID "obsoleteCmd".

	* expect.tcl: upgraded to work with Expect 5.31.  exp_interact
	called with -eof, -timeout, or -timestamp give obsoleteCmd error.
	expect (and other similar commands) called with -timestamp or
	-iwrite give a "use -gl" warning and the flags are interpreted as
	pattern arguments, as of Expect 5.31.  exp_interpreter can be
	called with the "-eof script" option as of Expect 5.31.

	* coreTcl.tcl: added checking support for debugger_break and new
	options for debugger_eval.

	* coreTk.tcl: tkerror command gives the obsoleteCmd error as of
	Tk8.0.

1999-07-26  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* configure.tcl: fixed crashing checker bug when run with -use
	Tcl7.3 -use TclX.  Now the check catches the error and prints a
	message telling the user there is not compatible TclX version for
	Tcl7.3.

1999-07-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* configure.tcl: added -pcx command line option (rfe 2238)

1999-06-25  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	command is the only one that changed.

	* tclX.tcl: added missing "have_symlink" option to table entry for
	"infox" tclX command.

1999-06-23  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* expect.tcl: Fixed bug 2118.  Changed exp_sleep table entry to
	check argument with checkFloat rather than checkInt.  Added
	"break" in option parsing loop when "--" is encountered in the
	exp_send command.  Fixed un-logged bug that caused the argument
	of the -brace option to be re-checked.  

1999-06-22  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* analyzer.tcl:
	* message.tcl: Fixed bug 1314 by adding new message id
	"warnUndefProc".  In addition to listing the undefined procedures
	at the end if -verbose is specified, now the warning is triggered
	for the first use of the undefined proc on the line where it occurs
	regardless of the -verbose flag.

	* tclX.tcl: Fixed bug 984 by adding have_signal_restart and
	have_fchown options to TclX table entry for the infox command.
	Fixed bug 1124 by removing the "warn nonPortCmd" call from the
	TclX table entry for the dup command.

1999-06-21  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bug 459.  Changed table entry for the "event
	generate" command--now calls checkWidgetOptions instead of
	checkSwitches.  Removed the checkEventGenerate command, as it is
	nolonger called.

1999-06-18  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed bugs 522 and 1140.  Changed Tk table entries
	for tk_bindForTraversal and tk_menuBar to give warnUnsupported
	message with instruction to the the "menu" command instead.
	Replaced default "checkBody" call for "scale -command" with
	"checkWord" because the scale command appends args the -command's
	argument.

1999-06-17  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* tclX.tcl: Fixed bug 1749.  Changed tclX::checkLIndex to allow
	indices "len-<integer>" and "end-<integer>".

	* coreTcl.tcl: added new 8.1 switches for regexp and regsub.

1999-06-16  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* coreTcl.tcl: Fixed bug 2134:  checker did not accept new
	startIndex aruments for the string first and string last
	commands.  Also added checking for the new -nocase option to the
	string match command.

1999-05-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* coreTk.tcl: 
	* coreTcl.tcl: 
	* configure.tcl: Added 8.1 support (string and encoding).

	* analyzer.tcl: Added analyzer::checkIndexExpr

1999-02-20    <surles@YODA>

	* context.tcl: The context::head API was always returning :: even
	if the original context was not a fully qualified path.  The fix
	was to return :: only if the context is fully qualified, otherwise
	return an empty  string. [Bug: 983]

	* userproc.tcl:  uproc::isRedefined tries to determine how
	the user proc was redefined.  Two procs w/ the same name, two
	classes w/ the same name, a proc and a class w/ the same name,
	etc.  The bug was that it would skip the first user proc with an
	identical signature, hoping to find a better message by looking at
	the next user proc on the list.  In the example above, the
	signatures are identical, so only one user proc was defined.  The
	skip happened, but there were no more user procs on the list.
	Thus the error was never logged.  The fix was to skip only if the
	signature were identical, a skip had not already been found, AND
	to see if there are more user procs on the list. [Bug: 1038]

1999-02-19    <surles@YODA>

	* configure.tcl: Fixed bug where the -verbose flag was reporting
	the wrong version of expect.

	* incrTcl.tcl: Fixed bug where the itcl:: aliases were only being
	made for version 3.0+ but should be done for 2.0+.

1999-02-17    <surles@YODA>

	* incrTcl.tcl: Added checkers for itcl::* commands so they are
	aliased to the corresponding commands. [Bug: 1214]


1999-01-20    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* coreTk.tcl: Fixed so unknown keysyms are always reported as
	nonportable instead of as bad events. [Bug: 267]

1999-01-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* expect.tcl: Added checkers for non exp* commands so they are
	lower priority than other extensions' checkers [Bug: 980]

1998-12-29    <surles@YODA>

	* analyzer.tcl: Moved generic widget checker from coreTk to
	analyzer.  Added new API to register generic widget configuration
	options.  Added a checkSwitches2 API that is identical to the 
	original checkSwitches, accept that it does not log errors if
	there are remaining args.  This is used in conjunction with the
	new checkTailArgs checker, that fixes the problems with checking
	lsort, lsearch, etc.

1999-01-06    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* coreTcl.tcl: Changed SCCS string to RCS string.

	* analyzer.tcl: Fixed minor typos and removed an overly
	complicated regular expression.

1998-12-01    <surles@YODA>

	* coreTk.tcl: The bind command was checking for events not event
	sequences. [#886:bug fix]

1998-11-18    <surles@YODA>

	* analyzer.tcl: Merged the scan and checker tables so data is not
	repeated in the two tables.  The scan table now has a flag that
	indicates that a command should be scanned, then the checker in
	the checker table is used to scan the command.  [#837:bug fix]

1998-11-16    <surles@YODA>

	* tclX.tcl: Filled in tables of TclX commands to be scanned and
	checked. [#828:new feature]

	* message.tcl: Added new message IDs: badByteNum and
	mismatchedOptions [new feature]

	* expect.tcl: Added comands that need to be scanned when checking
	Expect bodies. [#829: bug fix]

	* analyzer.tcl: (analyzer::checkByteNum) Added checker that
	verifies the word is an integer between 0 and 255.  This is used
	by TclX, but I thought it was generic enough. [#828:new checker]
