# TclPro 1.4.1

So far, this is a [copy from SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tclpro/).
[Here](http://www.tcl.tk/software/tclpro/) you can find further information.

I want to investigate possibilities of getting the tcldebugger started up again for Tcl 8.6 and later. And what could be done in the Tcl 8.6 core to support or enable default hooks for it. Probably without the debugger being a part of the distribution.

This is tangentially related to [Tcl-bounties](https://github.com/flightaware/Tcl-bounties) @ Revive the Tcl Pro debugger.
