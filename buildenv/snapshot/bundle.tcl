# Prototype program to bundle different parts of the TclPro build into

#
# Requires the SNAPSHOT file that the modified buildModule.tcl constructs
# over subsequent installations of various pieces to figure out what
# installation produced what file in the out directory.

# Results:
#
#	Makes a zipfiles directory in the out directory.
#	Reads SNAPSHOT.merge from the current directory.
#	Creates one or more zip files for each module that has a
