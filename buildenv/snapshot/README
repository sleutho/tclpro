SNAPSHOT TOOLS

This directory contains snapshot tools, pieces of code currently under
development to help us in figuring out which files and packages
in a release were put there by which modules.

After doing a successful "make" to build everything, a file called
SNAPSHOT will have been produced in same directory where you invoke "make"

For me, I'm building in /usr/tclpro/src/tclpro/freebsd-ix86, and it appears
there.

From there, run

tcl ../snapshot/postpro.tcl

...to produce the SNAPSHOT.merge file, grinding all of the SNAPSHOT data into
a concise representation of what modules produced what files and packages.

You can examine SNAPSHOT.merge by hand.  If it looks way out of whack,
try doing an "rm -rf out", deleting SNAPSHOT and SOFTSTATUS (or at least
editing SOFTSTATUS to remove all of the "install" lines) and doing a
"make" again, then retrying postpro.tcl.

Then run 

tcl ../snapshot/bundle.tcl

...to produce the zipfiles directory and its contents underneath the top
level of the directory you're executing make from.
(for me, /usr/tclpro/src/tclpro/freebsd-ix86/zipfiles) and create all
of the zipfiles for the release.
